              </div>
              <p> John Patrick is currently studying at the University of the Philippines Open University. He has been working in Japan in the field of Software Quality Assurance for three years. Recently, his dedication to learning Japanese has led him to pass the <b>Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level N2 </b> exam, and is currently preparing for the most difficult level, the JLPT N1. He spends most of his free time listening to self-improvement audiobooks while simultaneously managing his daily chores. His favorite book is <i>Atomic Habits</i>, which taught him how a single habit can determine the trajectory of our lives. </p>

              <p> John loves traveling and exploring new places. For him, every journey is an opportunity to immerse himself in different cultures, experience breathtaking landscapes, and create unforgettable memories. Last month, he took his parents on a special anniversary trip to Hong Kong and Macau to celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary. The trip was filled with sightseeing, delicious food, and cherished family moments. </p>

              <p> John feels his best when he is in shape, so he makes it a habit to train at the gym regularly. Strength training not only improves his physical fitness but also makes him mentally stronger. Here is a photo of him participating in an obstacle course event in Japan called the Spartan Race Super‚Äîa 10km marathon featuring 25 challenging obstacles. </p>
